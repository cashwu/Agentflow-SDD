# Task verification coverage incomplete

A task is marked complete after testing the primary outcome but omits one or more verification branches explicitly named in the task or implementation contract, leaving the completion claim stronger than the regression evidence.

## Occurrences

- 2026-07-14 — repair-all-uses-pinned-commit-inputs — spectra-apply-plus round 1 — current-state error tests initially omitted fail-and-continue across targets and the required dry-run error/no-state branch even though both were explicit verification targets.
- 2026-07-16 — converge-plus-review-loop — spectra-apply-plus round 2 — impact granularity advisory 的測試只鎖定標題與 `> 15` 主路徑，未鎖定 task/spec 明定的 `(none)` 排除及 15 靜默、16 警告邊界。
